### This is almost private porject.

I made this repo public because I thought my code is not that valuable to hide from others.

##### Ptracker is progress tracker.

I wanted to make nested progress trakcer but with cli. I used task warrior before but I've always wanted more like a hierarchical program.

##### Also I'm learning Rust and want to apply some concepts by my hands.


### TODO

1. Make hierarchy for real.

    Currently progresses are not nested and only exists on root directory.

2. Make cli arguments cleaner.
